# maze_solver
A robot that maps a maze and finds the shortest path. An innovatory method of randomness is 
devised for mapping purpose and the map is stored in a 3-D character array. For finding the 
shortest path, concurrent Dijkstra's Algorithm or method of wavefronts is used. Hardware 
used is Atmega32 microcontroller.
